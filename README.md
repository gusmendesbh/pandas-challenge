# Background

You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

The results indicate that Charter Schools perform better, the reason behind that could be that they have a bigger flexibility with their structure to achieve better results. Since Charter Schools are also privately funded, it's management tend to be more effective towards results.
The admission process on both types of schools is different, and due to the smaller availability on Charter Schools, a "better" selection could be made.

- Charter Schools serve less students, with a smaller average budget per student and achieve better results on all metrics.

- District schoolls have a much better reading score over math scores

- Schools on the highest tier of spending ranges have the lowest overall passing
